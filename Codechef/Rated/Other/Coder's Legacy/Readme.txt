This was a Rated contest taken by KGEC in July 2020.
Could solve only 2 question with 4 penalties(all TLEs)
1. Simple ad-Hoc - Just Check for Even number during array input , and if there is a even number
print NO
2. Maths- A simple formula that inside the queries , X1+Y1 should be equal to M, i.e. here M
 is the sum of x,y, co-ordinates of the lines(e.g. 5,0). if it touches any of the lines,
print -1,and if isnt just check for the number of lines below it(x1+y1), using lower_bound.
